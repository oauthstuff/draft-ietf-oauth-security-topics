    <abstract>
      <t>This draft proposes an additional JSON Web Token (JWT) based response 
      for OAuth 2.0 Token Introspection.</t>
    </abstract>
  </front>

  <middle>
    <section anchor="Introduction" title="Introduction">
      <t><xref target="RFC7662">OAuth 2.0 Token Introspection</xref> specifies a 
      method for a protected resource to query an OAuth 2.0 authorization server 
      to determine the state of an access token and obtain data associated with
      the access token.
      This allows deployments to implement identifier-based access tokens 
      in an interoperable way.</t>
      <t>The introspection response, as specified in <xref target="RFC7662">OAuth
      2.0 Token Introspection</xref>, is a plain JSON object.
      However, there are use cases where the resource server requires stronger
      assurance that the authorization server issued the access token,
      including cases where the authorization server assumes liability for the
      token's content. An example is a resource server using verified person
      data to create certificates, which in turn are used to create qualified 
      electronic signatures.</t>
      <t>In such use cases it may be useful or even required to return a
      signed JWT as the introspection response. This specification extends the
      token introspection endpoint with the capability to return responses as
      JWTs.</t>

	  <t>Depending on the specific resource server policy the JWT is either
      signed, or signed and encrypted. If the JWT is signed and encrypted it
      MUST be a Nested JWT, as defined in <xref target="RFC7519">JWT</xref>.</t>
	  <t>Note: If the resource server policy requires a signed and encrypted
      response and the authorization server receives an unauthenticated request
	  containing an Accept header with content type other than "application/jwt", it MUST
      refuse to serve the request and return an HTTP status code 400. This is
      done to prevent downgrading attacks to obtain token data intended for
      release to legitimate recipients only

      <t>JWT introspection responses and OpenID Connect ID Tokens are 
      syntactically similar. An attacker could therefore attempt to impersonate
      an end-user at a OpenID Connect relying party by passing the JWT as an ID
      token.</t>
      
      <t>Such an attack can be prevented like any other token substitution
      attack. The authorization server MUST include the claims
      <spanx style="verb">iss</spanx> and <spanx style="verb">aud</spanx> in
      each JWT introspection response, with the <spanx style="verb">iss</spanx> 
      value set to the authorization server's issuer URL and the 
      <spanx style="verb">aud</spanx> value set
      to the resource server's identifier. This allows a correctly implemented
      OpenID Connect relying party to detect substitution by checking the
      <spanx style="verb">iss</spanx> and
      <spanx style="verb">aud</spanx> claims as described in Section 3.1.3.7. of 
      <xref target="OpenID.Core"/>. Relying parties SHOULD also use and check
      the <spanx style="verb">nonce</spanx> parameter and claim to prevent
      token and code replay.</t>
      
      <t>Resource servers utilizing JWTs to represent self-contained access
      tokens could be susceptible to replay attacks. Resource servers
      should therefore apply proper counter measures against replay as 
      described in <xref target="I-D.ietf-oauth-security-topics"/>, 
      section 2.2.</t>

     <t>The authorization server MUST use Transport Layer Security (TLS) 1.2 
      (or higher) per <xref target="RFC7525"/> in order to prevent token data leakage.</t>
      <t>To prevent introspection of leaked tokens and to present an additional
      security layer against token guessing attacks the authorization server
      may require all requests to the token introspection endpoint to be
      authenticated. As an alternative or as an addition to the authentication,
      the intended recipients may be set up for encrypted responses.</t>
      <t>In the latter case, confidentiality is ensured by the fact that only
      the legitimate recipient is able to decrypt the response.
      An attacker could try to circumvent this measure by requesting a plain 
      JSON response, using an Accept header with the content type set
      to, for example, "application/json" instead of "application/jwt". To prevent this
      attack the authorization server MUST NOT serve requests with content type
      other than "application/jwt" if the resource server is set up to receive
