          <t>Gives a comprehensive threat model for OAuth and describes the

        </list>Threats include any intentional attacks on OAuth tokens and
      resources protected by OAuth tokens as well as security risks introduced
      if the proper security measures are not put in place. Threats are
      structured along the lines of the protocol structure to aid development
      teams implement each part of the protocol securely. For example all
      threats for granting access or all threats for a particular client
      profile or all threats for protecting the resource server.</t>

    <section title="Overview">
      <t></t>

      <section title="Scope">
        <t>The security considerations document only considers clients bound
        to a particular deployment as supported by <xref
        target="I-D.ietf-oauth-v2"></xref>. Such deployments have the
        following characteristics:</t>

        <t><list style="symbols">
            <t>Resource server URLs are static and well-known at development
            time, authorization server URLs can be static or discovered.</t>

            <t>Token scope values (e.g. applicable URLs and methods) are
            well-known at development time.</t>

            <t>Client registration: Since registration of clients is out of
            scope of the current core spec, this document assumes a broad
            variety of options from static registration during development
            time to dynamic registration at runtime.</t>
          </list>The following are considered out of scope :</t>

        <t><list style="symbols">
            <t>Communication between authorization server and resource
            server</t>

            <t>Token formats</t>

            <t>Except for &bdquo;Resource Owner Password Credentials&ldquo;
            (see <xref target="I-D.ietf-oauth-v2"></xref>, section 4.3), the
            mechanism used by authorization servers to authenticate the
            user</t>

            <t>Mechanism by which a user obtained an assertion and any
            resulting attacks mounted as a result of the assertion being
            false.</t>

            <t>Clients are not bound to a specific deployment: An example
            could by a mail client with support for contact list access via
            the portable contacts API (see <xref
            target="portable-contacts"></xref>). Such clients cannot be
            registered upfront with a particular deployment and must
            dynamically discover the URLs relevant for the OAuth protocol.</t>
          </list></t>
      </section>

      <section title="Attack Assumptions">
        <t>The following assumptions relate to an attacker and resources
        available to an attacker:</t>

        <t><list style="symbols">
            <t>It is assumed the attacker has full access to the network
            between the client and authorization servers and the client and
            the resource server, respectively. The attacker may eaves drop on
            any communications between those parties. He is not assumed to
            have access to communication between authorization and resource
            server.</t>

            <t>It is assumed an attacker has unlimited resources to mount an
            attack.</t>

            <t>It is assumed that 2 of the 3 parties involved in the OAuth
            protocol may collude to mount an attack against the 3rd party. For
            example, the client and authorization server may be under control
            of an attacker and collude to trick a user to gain access to
            resources.</t>
          </list></t>
      </section>

      <section title="Architectural assumptions">
        <t>This section documents the assumptions about the features,
        limitations and design options of the different entities of a OAuth
        deployment along with the security-sensitive data-elements managed by
        those entity. These assumptions are the foundation of the treat
        analysis.</t>

        <t>The OAuth protocol leaves deployments with a certain degree of
        freedom how to implement and apply the standard. The core
        specification defines the core concepts of an authorization server and
        a resource server. Both servers can be implemented in the same server
        entity, or they may also be different entities. The later is typically
        the case for multi-service providers with a single authentication and
        authorization system, and are more typical in middleware
        architectures.</t>

        <section title="Authorization Servers">
          <t>The following data elements MAY be stored or accessible on the
          authorization server:</t>

          <t><list style="symbols">
              <t>user names and passwords</t>

              <t>client ids and secrets</t>

              <t>client-specific refresh tokens</t>

              <t>client-specific access tokens (in case of handle-based
              design)</t>

              <t>HTTPS certificate/key</t>

              <t>per authorization process (in case of handle-based design):
              redirect_uri, client_id, authorization code</t>
            </list></t>
        </section>

        <section title="Resource Server">
          <t>The following data elements MAY be stored or accessible on the
          resource server:</t>

          <t><list style="symbols">
              <t>user data (out of scope)</t>

              <t>HTTPS certificate/key</t>

              <t>authz server shared secret/public key (assertion-based
              design)</t>

              <t>access tokens (per request)</t>
            </list> It is assumed that a resource server has no knowledge of
          refresh tokens, user passwords, or client secrets.</t>

        <section title="Client">
          <t>A full definition of different client types and profiles is given
          in <xref target="I-D.ietf-oauth-v2"></xref>, Section 2.1.</t>

          <t>The following data elements are stored or accessible on the
          client:</t>

          <t><list style="symbols">
              <t>client id (and client secret or corresponding client
              credential)</t>

              <t>one or more refresh tokens (persistent) and access tokens

    <section title="Security Features">
      <t>These are some of the security features which have been built into
      the OAuth 2.0 protocol to mitigate attacks and security issues.</t>

      <section title="Tokens">
        <t>OAuth makes extensive use of all kinds of tokens (access tokens,
        refresh tokens, authorization codes). The information content of a
        token can be represented in two ways as follows:</t>

        <t><list style="hanging">
            <t hangText="Handle (or artifact)">a reference to some internal
            data structure within the authorization server, the internal data
            structure contains the attributes of the token, such as user id,
            scope, etc. Handles enable simple revocation and do not require
            cryptographic mechanisms to protected token content from being
            modified. On the other hand, handles require communication between
            issuing and consuming entity (e.g. authorization and resource
            server) in order to validate the token and obtain token-bound
            data. This communication might have an negative impact on
            performance and scalability if both entities reside on different
            system. Handles are therefore typically used if the issuing and
            consuming entity are the same. A 'handle' token is often referred
            to as an 'opaque' token because the resource server does not need
            to be able to interpret the token directly, it simply uses the
            token.</t>

            <t hangText="Assertions (aka self-contained token)">a parseable
            token. An assertion typically has a duration, an audience, and is
            digitally signed containing information about the user and the
            client. Examples of assertion formats are SAML assertions and
            Kerberos tickets. Assertions can typically directly be validated
            and used by a resource server without interactions with the
            authorization server. This results in better performance and
            scalability in deployment where issuing and consuming entity
            reside on different systems. Implementing token revocation is more
            difficult with assertions than with handles.</t>
          </list>Tokens can be used in two ways to invoke requests on resource
        servers as follows:</t>

        <t><list style="hanging">
            <t hangText="bearer token">A 'bearer token' is a token that can be
            used by any client who has received the token (e.g. <xref
            target="I-D.ietf-oauth-v2-bearer"></xref>). Because mere
            possession is enough to use the token it is important that
            communication between end-points be secured to ensure that only
            authorized end-points may capture the token. The bearer token is
            convenient to client applications as it does not require them to
            do anything to use them (such as a proof of identity). Bearer
            tokens have similar characteristics to web single-sign-on (SSO)
            cookies used in browsers.</t>

            <t hangText="proof token">A 'proof token' is a token that can only
            be used by a specific client. Each use of the token, requires the
            client to perform some action that proves that it is the
            authorized user of the token. Examples of this are MAC tokens,
            which require the client to digitally sign the resource request
            with a secret corresponding to the particular token send with the
            request (e.g.<xref
            target="I-D.ietf-oauth-v2-http-mac"></xref>).</t>
          </list></t>

        <section title="Scope">
          <t>A Scope represents the access authorization associated with a
          particular token with respect to resource servers, resources and
          methods on those resources. Scopes are the OAuth way to explicitly
          manage the power associated with an access token. A scope can be
          controlled by the authorization server and/or the end-user in order
          to limit access to resources for OAuth clients these parties deem
          less secure or trustworthy. Optionally, the client can request the
          scope to apply to the token but only for lesser scope than would
          otherwise be granted, e.g. to reduce the potential impact if this
          token is sent over non secure channels. A scope is typically
          complemented by a restriction on a token's lifetime.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Expires_In">
          <t>Expires_In allows an authorization server (based on its policies
          or on behalf of the end-user) to limit the lifetime of the access
          token. This mechanisms can be used to issue short-living tokens to
          OAuth clients the authorization server deems less secure or where
          sending tokens over non secure channels.</t>
        </section>
      </section>

      <section title="Access Token">
        <t>An access token is used by a client to access a resource. Access
        tokens typically have short life-spans (minutes or hours) that cover
        typical session lifetimes. An access token may be refreshed through
        the use of a refresh token. The short lifespan of an access token in
        combination with the usage of refresh tokens enables the possibility
        of passive revocation of access authorization on the expiry of the
        current access token.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Refresh Token">
        <t>A refresh token represents a long-lasting authorization of a
        certain client to access resources on behalf of a resource owner. Such
        tokens are exchanged between client and authorization server, only.
        Clients use this kind of token to obtain ("refresh") new access tokens
        used for resource server invocations.</t>

        <t>A refresh token, coupled with a short access token lifetime, can be
        used to grant longer access to resources without involving end user
        authorization. This offers an advantage where resource servers and
        authorization servers are not the same entity, e.g. in a distributed
        environment, as the refresh token must always be exchanged at the
        authorization server. The authorization server can revoke the refresh
        token at any time causing the granted access to be revoked once the
        current access token expires. Because of this, a short access token
        lifetime is important if timely revocation is a high priority.</t>

        <t>The refresh token is also a secret bound to the client identifier
        and <spanx style="emph">instance</spanx> which originally requested
        the authorization and representing the original resource owner grant.
        This is ensured by the authorization process as follows:</t>

        <t><list style="numbers">
            <t>The resource owner and user-agent safely deliver the
            authorization code to the client instance in first place.</t>

            <t>The client uses it immediately in secure transport-level
            communications to the authorization server and then securely
            stores the long-lived refresh token.</t>

            <t>The client always uses the refresh token in secure
            transport-level communications to the authorization server to get
            an access token (and optionally rollover the refresh token).</t>
          </list>So as long as the confidentiality of the particular token can
        be ensured by the client, a refresh tokens can also be used as an
        alternative mean to authenticate the client instance itself.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Authorization Code">
        <t>An Authorization Code represents the intermediary result of a
        successful end-user authorization process and is used by the client to
        obtain access and refresh token. Authorization codes are sent to the
        client's redirection URI instead of tokens for two purposes.</t>

        <t><list style="numbers">
            <t>Instead of (longer-lasting) tokens, the short-living
            authorization code is exposed to potential attackers via URI query
            parameters (HTTP referrer), browser cacher or log file
            entries.</t>

            <t>It is much simpler to authenticate clients during the direct
            request between client and authorization server than in the
            context of the indirect authorization request. The later would
            require digital signatures.</t>
          </list></t>
      </section>

      <section title="Redirection URI">
        <t>A redirection URI helps to detect malicious client and prevents
        phishing attacks from clients attempting to trick the user into
        believing the phisher is the client. The value of the actual
        redirection URI used in the authorization request has to be presented
        and is verified when an authorization code is exchanged for tokens.
        This helps to prevent attacks, where the authorization code is
        revealed through redirectors and counterfeit web application clients.
        The authorization server requires public clients and confidential
        clients using implicit grant type to pre-register their redirect URIs
        and validate agains the registered redirection URI in the
        authorization request.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="State parameter">
        <t>The state parameter is used to link requests and callbacks to
        prevent CSRF attacks where an attacker authorizes access to his own
        resources and then tricks a users into following a redirect with the
        attacker's token. It should bind to the authenticated state in a user
        agent and the user agent must be capable of keeping it in a location
        accessible only by the client and user agent, i.e. protected by
        same-origin policy</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Client Identity">
        <t>Authentication protocols have typically not taken into account the
        identity of the software component acting on behalf of the end-user.
        OAuth does this in order to increase the security level in delegated
        authorization scenarios and because the client will be able to act
        without the user being present.</t>

        <t>OAuth uses the <spanx style="emph">client_id</spanx> (client
        identity) to collate associated request to the same originator, such
        as</t>

        <t><list style="symbols">
            <t>a particular end-user authorization process and the
            corresponding request on the tokens endpoint to exchange the
            authorization code for tokens or</t>

            <t>the initial authorization and issuance of a tokens by an
            end-user to a particular client and sub-sequent requests by this
            client to obtain tokens w/o user consent (automatic processing of
            repeated authorization)</t>
          </list>The client identity may also be used by the authorization
        server to display relevant registration information to a user when
        requesting consent for scope requested by a particular client. The
        client identity may be used to limit the number of request for a
        particular client or to charge the client per request. Client Identity
        may furthermore be useful to differentiate access by different
        clients, e.g. in server log files.</t>

        <t>OAuth defines two client types, confidential and public, based on
        their ability to authenticate securely with the authorization server
        (i.e. ability to maintain the confidentiality of their client
        credentials). Confidential clients are capable of maintaining the
        confidentiality of client credentials (i.e. a client secret associated
        with the client identifier) or capable of secure client authentication
        using other means, such as a client assertion (e.g. SAML) or key
        cryptography. The latter is considered more secure.</t>

        <t>The authorization server should determine whether the client is
        capable of keeping its secret confidential or using secure
        authentication. Alternatively, the <spanx style="emph">end-user</spanx>
        can verify the identity of the client, e.g. by only installing trusted
        applications.The <spanx style="emph">redirection URI</spanx> can be
        used to prevent delivering credentials to a counterfeit client after
        obtaining end-user authorization, but can't be used to verify the
        client identity.</t>

        <t>Clients can be categorized as follows based on the client type,
        profile (e.g. native vs web application) and deployment model:</t>

        <t><list style="hanging">
            <t
            hangText="Deployment-independent client_id with pre-registered redirect_uri and without client_secret">Such
            an identity is used by multiple installations of the same software
            package. The identity of such a client can only be validated with
            the help of the end-user. This is a viable option for native
            applications in order to identify the client for the purpose of
            displaying meta information about the client to the user and to
            differentiate clients in log files. Revocation of such an identity
            will affect ALL deployments of the respective software.</t>

            <t
            hangText="Deployment-independent client_id with pre-registered redirect_uri and with client_secret">This
            is an option for native applications only, since web application

            advisable because the client secret cannot be protected
            appropriately (see <xref target="ObtainClientSecrets"></xref>).
            Due to its security weaknesses, such client identities have the
            same trust level as deployment-independent clients without secret.

            relevant use cases cited above. This level can be achieved for web
            applications in combination with a manual or user-bound
            registration process. Achieving this level for native applications
            is much more difficult. Either the installation of the application

            <t>An attacker could try to eavesdrop transmission of the
            authorization code between authorization server and client.
            Furthermore, authorization codes are passed via the browser which
            may unintentionally leak those codes to untrusted web sites and
            attackers by different ways:</t>

            <t><list style="symbols">
                <t>Referrer headers: browsers frequently pass a
                &ldquo;referer&rdquo; header when a web page embeds content,
                or when a user travels from one web page to another web page.
                These referrer headers may be sent even when the origin site
                does not trust the destination site. The referee header is
                commonly logged for traffic analysis purposes.</t>

                <t>Request logs: web server request logs commonly include
                query parameters on requests.</t>

                <t>Open redirectors: web sites sometimes need to send users to
                another destination via a redirector. Open redirectors pose a
                particular risk to web-based delegation protocols because the
                redirector can leak verification codes to untrusted
                destination sites.</t>

                <t>Browser history: web browsers commonly record visited URLs
                in the browser history. Another user of the same web browser

          <section anchor="mal_client"
                   title="Threat: Malicious client obtains authorization">
            <t>A malicious client could counterfeit a valid client and obtain
            an access authorization that way. The malicious client could even
            utilize screen scraping techniques in order to simulate the user
            consent in the authorization flow.</t>

            <t>Assumption: It is not the task of the authorization server to
            protect the end-user's device from malicious software. This is the
            responsibility of the platform running on the particular device
            probably in cooperation with other components of the respective
            ecosystem (e.g. an application management infrastructure). The
            sole responsibility of the authorization server is to control
            access to the end-user's resources living in resource servers and
            to prevent unauthorized access to them. Based on this assumption,
            the following countermeasures are available to cope with the
            threat.</t>

            <t>Countermeasures:</t>

            <t><list style="symbols">
                <t>The authorization server should authentication the client,
                if possible (see <xref
                target="depl_specific_secretes"></xref>). Note: the
                authentication takes place after the end-user has authorized
                the access.</t>

                <t>The authorization server should validate the client's
                redirection URI against the pre-registered redirection URI, if
                one exists (see <xref target="val_redirect"></xref>). Note:
                The validation of the redirection URI is the only technical
                mean to recognize a malicious client id in advance of the
                authorization process. Further note this does not work for
                native applications because in contrast to web applications
                this URI is not bound to a single communication endpoint. The
                valid client's redirection URI (typically with custom scheme)
                can be used by a malicious client on any device.</t>

                <t>After authenticating the end-user, the authorization server
                should ask him/her for consent. In this context, the user
                shall be explained the purpose, scope, and duration of the
                authorization. Moreover, the authorization server must view to
                the end-user the meta data it associates with the particular
                client. It is up to the user to validate the binding of this
                data to the particular application (e.g. Name) and to approve
                the authorization request. (see <xref
                target="validation_end_user"></xref>).</t>

                <t>The authorization server must not perform automatic
                re-authorizations for clients it is unable to reliably
                authenticate or validate (see <xref
                target="automatic_processing"></xref>).</t>

                <t>If the authorization server automatically authenticates the
                end-user, it may nevertheless require some user input in order
                to prevent screen scraping. Examples are CAPTCHAs or
                user-specific secret like PIN codes.</t>

                <t>The authorization server may also limit the scope of tokens
                it issues to clients it cannot reliably authenticate (see
                <xref target="limit_scope"></xref>).</t>

          <section title="Threat: Authorization code phishing">
            <t>A hostile party could impersonate the client site and get
            access to the authorization code. This could be achieved using DNS
            or ARP spoofing. This applies to clients, which are web
            applications, thus the redirect URI is not local to the host where
            the user's browser is running.</t>

            <t>Impact: This affects web applications and may lead to a
            disclosure of authorization codes and, potentially, the

            <t>Countermeasures:</t>

            <t>It is strongly recommended that one of the following
            countermeasures is utilized in order to prevent this attack:</t>

            <t><list style="symbols">
                <t>The redirection URI of the client SHOULD point to a HTTPS
                protected endpoint and the browser shall be utilized to

                (see <xref target="server_authn"></xref>).</t>

                <t>The authorization server SHOULD require the client to be
                authenticated, i.e. confidential client, so the binding of the
                authorization code to a certain client can be validated in a
                reliable way (see <xref
                target="bind_code_client_id"></xref>).</t>
              </list></t>
          </section>

          <section title="Threat: User session impersonation">
            <t>A hostile party could impersonate the client site and
            impersonate the user's session on this client. This could be
            achieved using DNS or ARP spoofing. This applies to clients, which
            are web applications, thus the redirect URI is not local to the
            host where the user's browser is running.</t>

            <t>Impact: An attacker who intercepts the authorization code as it
            is sent by the browser to the callback endpoint can gain access to
            protected resources by submitting the authorization code to the
            client. The client will exchange the authorization code for an
            access token and use the access token to access protected
            resources for the benefit of the attacker, delivering protected
            resources to the attacker, or modifying protected resources as
            directed by the attacker. If OAuth is used by the client to
            delegate authentication to a social site (e.g. as in the
            implementation of the "Facebook Login" button), the attacker can
            use the intercepted authorization code to log in to the client as
            the user.</t>

            <t>Note: Authenticating the client during authorization code
            exchange will not help to detect such an attack as it is the
            legitimate client that obtains the tokens.</t>

            <t>The attack leverages the authorization code grant type in an
            attempt to get another user (victim) to log-in, authorize access
            to his/her resources, and subsequently obtain the authorization
            code and inject it into a client application using the attacker's
            account. The goal is to associate an access authorization for
            resources of the victim with the user account of the attacker on a
            client site.</t>

            <t>The attacker abuses an existing client application and combines
            it with his own counterfeit client web site. The attack depends on
            the victim expecting the client application to request access to a
            certain resource server. The victim, seeing only a normal request
            from an expected application, approves the request. The attacker
            then uses the victim's authorization to gain access to the
            information unknowingly authorized by the victim.</t>

            <t>The attacker conducts the following flow:</t>

            <t><list style="numbers">
                <t>The attacker accesses the client web site (or application)
                and initiates data access to a particular resource server. The
                client web site in turn initiates an authorization request to
                the resource server's authorization server. Instead of
                proceeding with the authorization process, the attacker
                modifies the authorization server end-user authorization URL
                as constructed by the client to include a redirection URI
                parameter referring to a web site under his control
                (attacker's web site).</t>

                <t>The attacker tricks another user (the victim) to open that
                modified end-user authorization URI and to authorize access
                (e.g. an email link, or blog link). The way the attacker
                achieve that goal is out of scope.</t>

                <t>Having clicked the link, the victim is requested to
                authenticate and authorize the client site to have access.</t>

                <t>After completion of the authorization process, the
                authorization server redirects the user agent to the
                attacker's web site instead of the original client web
                site.</t>

                <t>The attacker obtains the authorization code from his web
                site by means out of scope of this document.</t>

                <t>He then constructs a redirection URI to the target web site
                (or application) based on the original authorization request's
                redirection URI and the newly obtained authorization code and
                directs his user agent to this URL. The authorization code is
                injected into the original client site (or application).</t>

                <t>The client site uses the authorization code to fetch a
                token from the authorization server and associates this token

                associates the authorization code with the redirection URI of

            <t>Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) is a web-based attack whereby
            HTTP requests are transmitted from a user that the website trusts
            or has authenticated (e.g., via HTTP redirects or HTML forms).
            CSRF attacks on OAuth approvals can allow an attacker to obtain
            authorization to OAuth protected resources without the consent of
            the User.</t>

            <t>This attack works against the redirection URI used in the
            authorization code flow. An attacker could authorize an
            authorization code to their own protected resources on an
            authorization server. He then aborts the redirect flow back to the
            client on his device and tricks the victim into executing the
            redirect back to the client. The client receives the redirect,
            fetches the token(s) from the authorization server and associates
            the victim's client session with the resources accessible using
            the token.</t>

            <t>Impact: The user accesses resources on behalf of the attacker.
            The effective impact depends on the type of resource accessed. For
            example, the user may upload private items to an attacker's
            resources. Or when using OAuth in 3rd party login scenarios, the
            user may associate his client account with the attacker's identity
            at the external identity provider. This way the attacker could
            easily access the victim's data at the client by logging in from

          <section title="Threat: Resource Owner Impersonation">
            <t>When a client requests access to protected resources, the
            authorization flow normally involves the resource owner's explicit
            response to the access request, either granting or denying access
            to the protected resources. A malicious client can exploit
            knowledge of the structure of this flow in order to gain
            authorization without the resource owner's consent, by
            transmitting the necessary requests programmatically, and
            simulating the flow against the authorization server. That way,
            the client may gain access to the victims resources without her
            approval. An authorization server will be vulnerable to this
            threat, if it uses non-interactive authentication mechanisms or
            split the authorization flow across multiple pages.</t>

            <t>The malicious client might embbed a hidden HTML user agent,

            authorization process in the context of an already authenticated
            session of the resource owner with the authorization server. There
            are different ways to achieve this:</t>

                <t>It could also request authorization for a particular scope
                and silently abuse the resulting session in his browser
                instance to "silently" request another scope.</t>

                <t>Alternatively, the attacker might exploit an authorization
                server's aibility to authenticate the resource owner

            <t>Please note: Such attacks cannot be prevented using CSRF

            <t>An attacker who owns a botnet can locate the redirect URIs of
            clients that listen on HTTP, access them with random authorization
            codes, and cause a large number of HTTPS connections to be
            concentrated onto the authorization server. This can result in a
            DoS attack on the authorization server.</t>

            <t>This attack can still be effective even when CSRF defense/the
            'state' parameter are deployed on the client side. With such a
            defense, the attacker might need to incur an additional HTTP
            request to obtain a valid CSRF code/ state parameter. This
            apparently cuts down the effectiveness of the attack by a factor
            of 2. However, if the HTTPS/HTTP cost ratio is higher than 2 (the
            cost factor is estimated to be around 3.5x at
            http://www.semicomplete.com/blog/geekery/ssl-latency.html), the
            attacker still achieves a magnification of resource utilization at
            the expense of the authorization server.</t>

            <t>Impact: There are a few effects that the attacker can
            accomplish with this OAuth flow that they cannot easily achieve

                <t>Connection laundering: With the clients as the relay
                between the attacker and the authorization server, the
                authorization server learns little or no information about the
                identity of the attacker. Defenses such rate limiting on the
                offending attacker machines are less effective due to the
                difficulty to identify the attacking machines. Although an
                attacker could also launder its connections through an
                anonymizing systems such as Tor, the effectiveness of that
                approach depends on the capacity of the annoying system. On
                the other hand, a potentially large number of OAuth clients
                could be utilized for this attack.</t>

                <t>Asymmetric resource utilization: The attacker incurs the
                cost of an HTTP connection and causes an HTTPS connection to
                be made on the authorization server; and the attacker can
                co-ordinate the timing of such HTTPS connections across
                multiple clients relatively easily. Although the attacker
                could achieve something similar, say, by including an iframe
                pointing to the HTTPS URL of the authorization server in an
                HTTP web page and lure web users to visit that page, timing
                attacks using such a scheme may be more difficult as it seems
                nontrivial to synchronize a large number of users to

          <t>The &ldquo;Resource Owner Password Credentials&rdquo; grant type
          (see <xref target="I-D.ietf-oauth-v2"></xref>, Section 4.3), often
          used for legacy/migration reasons, allows a client to request an
          access token using an end-users user-id and password along with its
          own credential. This grant type has higher risk because it maintains
          the uid/password anti-pattern. Additionally, because the user does
          not have control over the authorization process, clients using this
          grant type are not limited by scope, but instead have potentially
          the same capabilities as the user themselves. As there is no
          authorization step, the ability to offer token revocation is
          bypassed.</t>

          <t>Impact: The resource server can only differentiate scope based on
          the access token being associated with a particular client. The

          <t>This is applicable to all requests sent from client to

          mechanism for verifying the integrity of requests, it provides no
          guarantee of request confidentiality. Unless further precautions are
          taken, eavesdroppers will have full access to request content and
          may be able to mount interception or replay attacks through using
          content of request, e.g. secrets or tokens.</t>

          <t>Attacks can be mitigated by using transport-layer mechanisms such
          as TLS or SSL. VPN may considered as well.</t>

          <t>The client MUST validate the binding of the server to its domain

          man-in-the-middle attack. The security measure depends on the
          certification authorities the client trusts for that purpose.

            <t>Refresh token rotation is intended to automatically detect and
            prevent attempts to use the same refresh token in parallel from
            different apps/devices. This happens if a token gets stolen from
            the client and is subsequently used by the attacker and the
            legitimate client. The basic idea is to change the refresh token
            value with every refresh request in order to detect attempts to
            obtain access tokens using old refresh tokens. Since the
            authorization server cannot determine whether the attacker or the
            legitimate client is trying to access, in case of such an access
            attempt the valid refresh token and the access authorization
            associated with it are both revoked.</t>

            <t>The OAuth specification supports this measure in that the

          the different client types, there are different ways to support
          achieve objectives, which will be described in this section.
          Authorization server providers should be aware of the security
          policy and deployment of a particular clients and adapt its
          treatment accordingly. For example, one approach could be to treat
          all clients as less trustworthy and unsecure. On the other extreme,
          a service provider could activate every client installation by hand
          of an administrator and that way gain confidence in the identity of
          the software package and the security of the environment the client
          is installed in. And there are several approaches in between.</t>

          <section anchor="dont_issue"
                   title="Don't issue secrets to public clients or clients with inappropriate security policy">
            <t>Authorization servers should not issue secrets to "public"
            clients that cannot protect secrets. This prevents the server from
            overestimating the value of a successful authentication of the
            client.</t>

            <t>For example, it is of limited benefit to create a single client
            id and secret which is shared by all installations of a native
            application. Such a scenario requires that this secret must be
            transmitted from the developer via the respective distribution
            channel, e.g. an application market, to all installations of the
            application on end-user devices. A secret, burned into the source
            code of the application or a associated resource bundle, cannot be
            entirely protected from reverse engineering. Secondly, such
            secrets cannot be revoked since this would immediately put all
            installations out of work. Moreover, since the authorization
            server cannot really trust on the client's identity, it would be
            dangerous to indicate to end-users the trustworthiness of the
            client.</t>

            <t>There are other ways to achieve a reasonable security level, as
            described in the following sections.</t>

            to a certain pre-configured redirect_uri. Any authorization
            request with another redirection URI is refused automatically.
            Alternatively, the authorization server MUST not accept any
            dynamic redirection URI for such a client_id and instead always
            redirect to the well-known pre-configured redirection URI. This is
            a countermeasure for clients without secrets against the following

                   title="Deployment-specific client secrets">
            <t>A authorization server may issue separate client identifiers
            and corresponding secrets to the different deployments of a
            client. The effect of such an approach would be to turn otherwise
            "public" clients back into "confidential" clients.</t>

            <t>For web applications, this could mean to create one client_id
            and client_secret per web site a software package is installed on.
            So the provider of that particular site could request client id
            and secret from the authorization server during setup of the web
            site. This would also allow to validate some of the properties of
            that web site, such as redirection URI, address, and whatever
            proofs useful. The web site provider has to ensure the security of
            the client secret on the site.</t>

            <t>For native applications, things are more complicated because
            every installation of the application on any device is another
            deployment. Deployment specific secrets will require</t>

              </list>Either approach will require an automated mechanism for
            issuing client ids and secrets, which is currently not defined by
            OAuth.</t>

            <t>The first approach would allow to achieve a level where the
            client is authenticated and identified, whereas the second option
            only allows to authenticate the client but not to validate
            properties of the client. But this would at least help to prevent
            several replay attacks. Moreover, deployment-specific client_id
            and secret allow to selectively revoke all refresh tokens of a
            specific deployment at once.</t>

          <t>Another option is to swap refresh token storage to a trusted
          backend server. This mean in turn requires a resilient
          authentication mechanisms between client and backend server. Note:
          Applications must ensure that confidential data are kept
          confidential even after reading from secure storage, which typically
          means to keep this data in the local memory of the application.</t>

                 title="Link state parameter to user agent session">
          <t>The state parameter is used to link client requests and prevent
          CSRF attacks, for example against the redirection URI. An attacker
          could inject their own authorization code or access token, which can
          result in the client using an access token associated with the
          attacker's protected resources rather than the victim's (e.g. save
          the victim's bank account information to a protected resource
          controlled by the attacker).</t>

          <t>The client SHOULD utilize the "state" request parameter to send
          the authorization server a value that binds the request to the
          user-agent's authenticated state (e.g. a hash of the session cookie
          used to authenticate the user-agent) when making an authorization
          request. Once authorization has been obtained from the end-user, the
          authorization server redirects the end-user's user-agent back to the
          client with the required binding value contained in the "state"
          parameter.</t>

          <t>The binding value enables the client to verify the validity of
          the request by matching the binding value to the user- agent's
          authenticated state.</t>

      <section title="Resource Servers">
        <t>The following section details security considerations for resource
        servers.</t>

        <section anchor="authz_header" title="Authorization headers">
          <t>Authorization headers are recognized and specially treated by
          HTTP proxies and servers. Thus the usage of such headers for sending
          access tokens to resource servers reduces the likelihood of leakage
          or unintended storage of authenticated requests in general and
          especially Authorization headers.</t>
        </section>

        <section anchor="authn_requests" title="Authenticated requests">
          <t>An authorization server may bind tokens to a certain client
          identity and encourage resource servers to validate that binding.
          This will require the resource server to authenticate the originator
          of a request as the legitimate owner of a particular token. There
          are a couple of options to implement this countermeasure:</t>

          <t><list style="symbols">
              <t>The authorization server may associate the distinguished name
              of the client with the token (either internally or in the
              payload of an self-contained token). The client then uses client
              certificate-based HTTP authentication on the resource server's
              endpoint to authenticate its identity and the resource server
              validates the name with the name referenced by the token.</t>

              <t>same as before, but the client uses his private key to sign
              the request to the resource server (public key is either
              contained in the token or sent along with the request)</t>

              <t>Alternatively, the authorization server may issue a
              token-bound secret, which the client uses to sign the request.
              The resource server obtains the secret either directly from the
              authorization server or it is contained in an encrypted section
              of the token. That way the resource server does not "know" the
              client but is able to validate whether the authorization server
              issued the token to that client</t>
            </list>This mechanisms is a countermeasure against abuse of tokens
          by counterfeit resource servers.</t>
        </section>

        <section anchor="signed_requests" title="Signed requests">
          <t>A resource server may decide to accept signed requests only,
          either to replace transport level security measures or to complement
          such measures. Every signed request must be uniquely identifiable
          and must not be processed twice by the resource server. This
          countermeasure helps to mitigate:</t>
