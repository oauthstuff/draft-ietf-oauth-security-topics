# Recommendations {#recommendations}
    
This section describes the set of security mechanisms the OAuth
working group recommends to OAuth implementers.

## Protecting Redirect-Based Flows {#rec_redirect}

Authorization servers MUST utilize exact matching of client redirect
URIs against pre-registered URIs. This measure contributes to the
prevention of leakage of authorization codes and access tokens
(depending on the grant type). It also helps to detect mix-up attacks
(see below).

Clients SHOULD avoid forwarding the userâ€™s browser to a URI obtained
from a query parameter since such a function could be utilized to
exfiltrate authorization codes and access tokens. If there is a strong
need for this kind of redirect, clients are advised to implement
appropriate countermeasures against open redirection, e.g., as
described by OWASP [@owasp_redir].


Clients MUST prevent Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF). In this
context, CSRF refers to redirections to the redirection endpoint that
do not originate at the authorization server, but a malicious third
party (see Section 4.4.1.8. of [@RFC6819] for details). One-time use
CSRF tokens carried in the `state` parameter, which are securely bound
to the user agent, SHOULD be used for that purpose. If PKCE [@RFC7636]
is used by the client and the client has ensured that the
authorization server supports PKCE, the client MAY opt to not use
`state` for CSRF protection, as such protection is provided by PKCE.
In this case, `state` MAY be used again for its original purpose,
namely transporting data about the application state of the client
(see (#csrf_countermeasures)).
        
        
In order to prevent mix-up attacks, clients MUST only process redirect
responses of the OAuth authorization server they sent the respective
request to and from the same user agent this authorization request was
initiated with. Clients MUST store the authorization server they
sent an authorization request to and bind this information to the user
agent and ensure any sub-sequent messages are sent to the same
authorization server. Clients SHOULD use AS-specific redirect URIs as
a means to identify the AS a particular response came from.

An AS which redirects a request that potentially contains user
credentials MUST avoid forwarding these user credentials accidentally
(see (#redirect_307)).


### Authorization Code Grant {#ac}

Clients utilizing the authorization grant type MUST use PKCE
[@!RFC7636] in order to (with the help of the authorization server)
detect and prevent attempts to inject (replay) authorization codes
into the authorization response. The PKCE challenges must be
transaction-specific and securely bound to the user agent in which the
transaction was started and the respective client. OpenID Connect
clients MAY use the `nonce` parameter of the OpenID Connect
authentication request as specified in [@!OpenID] in conjunction with
the corresponding ID Token claim for the same purpose.

Note: although PKCE so far was recommended as a mechanism to protect
native apps, this advice applies to all kinds of OAuth clients,
including web applications.

Clients SHOULD use PKCE code challenge methods that do not expose the
PKCE verifier in the authorization request. (Otherwise, the attacker
A4 can trivially break the security provided by PKCE.) Currently,
`S256` is the only such method.

AS MUST support PKCE [@!RFC7636].

AS MUST provide a way to detect their support for PKCE. To this end,
they MUST either (a) publish, in their AS metadata ([@!RFC8418]), the
element `code_challenge_methods_supported` containing the supported
PKCE challenge methods (which can be used by the client to detect PKCE
support) or (b) provide a deployment-specific way to ensure or
determine PKCE support by the AS.

Authorization servers SHOULD furthermore consider the recommendations
given in [@!RFC6819], Section 4.4.1.1, on authorization code replay
prevention.

### Implicit Grant
    
The implicit grant (response type "token") and other response types
causing the authorization server to issue access tokens in the
authorization response are vulnerable to access token leakage and
access token replay as described in (#insufficient_uri_validation),
(#credential_leakage_referrer), (#browser_history), and
(#access_token_injection).
    
Moreover, no viable mechanism exists to cryptographically bind access
tokens issued in the authorization response to a certain client as it
is recommended in (#token_replay_prevention). This makes replay
detection for such access tokens at resource servers impossible.
    
In order to avoid these issues, clients SHOULD NOT use the implicit
grant (response type "token") or any other response type issuing
access tokens in the authorization response, such as "token id\_token"
and "code token id\_token", unless the issued access tokens are
sender-constrained and access token injection in the authorization
response is prevented. 
 
A sender-constrained access token scopes the applicability of an access
token to a certain sender. This sender is obliged to demonstrate knowledge
of a certain secret as prerequisite for the acceptance of that token at
the recipient (e.g., a resource server).

Clients SHOULD instead use the response type "code" (aka authorization
code grant type) as specified in (#ac) or any other response type that
causes the authorization server to issue access tokens in the token
response. This allows the authorization server to detect replay
attempts and generally reduces the attack surface since access tokens
are not exposed in URLs. It also allows the authorization server to
sender-constrain the issued tokens.

## Token Replay Prevention {#token_replay_prevention}

Authorization servers SHOULD use TLS-based methods for
sender-constrained access tokens as described in (#pop_tokens), such
as token binding [@I-D.ietf-oauth-token-binding] or Mutual TLS for
OAuth 2.0 [@I-D.ietf-oauth-mtls] in order to prevent token replay.
Refresh tokens MUST be sender-constrained or use refresh token
rotation as described in (#refresh_token_protection). 

It is recommended to use end-to-end TLS whenever possible. If TLS
traffic needs to be terminated at an intermediary, refer to
(#tls_terminating) for further security advice.

## Access Token Privilege Restriction

The privileges associated with an access token SHOULD be restricted to the
minimum required for the particular application or use case. This prevents
clients from exceeding the privileges authorized by the resource owner. It also
prevents users from exceeding their privileges authorized by the respective
security policy. Privilege restrictions also limit the impact of token leakage
although more effective counter-measures are described in 
(#token_replay_prevention).

In particular, access tokens SHOULD be restricted to certain resource
servers, preferably to a single resource server. To put this into
effect, the authorization server associates the access token with
certain resource servers and every resource server is obliged to
verify for every request, whether the access token sent with that
request was meant to be used for that particular resource server. If
not, the resource server MUST refuse to serve the respective request.
Clients and authorization servers MAY utilize the parameters `scope`
or `resource` as specified in [@!RFC6749] and
[@I-D.ietf-oauth-resource-indicators], respectively, to determine the
resource server they want to access.

Additionally, access tokens SHOULD be restricted to certain resources
and actions on resource servers or resources. To put this into effect,
the authorization server associates the access token with the
respective resource and actions and every resource server is obliged
to verify for every request, whether the access token sent with that
request was meant to be used for that particular action on the
particular resource. If not, the resource server must refuse to serve
the respective request. Clients and authorization servers MAY utilize
the parameter `scope` as specified in [@!RFC6749] to determine those
resources and/or actions.

## Resource Owner Password Credentials Grant

The resource owner password credentials grant MUST NOT be used. This
grant type insecurely exposes the credentials of the resource owner to
the client. Even if the client is benign, this results in an increased
attack surface (credentials can leak in more places than just the AS)
and users are trained to enter their credentials in places other than
the AS.

Furthermore, adapting the resource owner password credentials grant to
two-factor authentication, authentication with cryptographic
credentials, and authentication processes that require multiple steps
can be hard or impossible (WebCrypto, WebAuthn).


## Client Authentication
Authorization servers SHOULD use client authentication if possible.

It is RECOMMENDED to use asymmetric (public key based) methods for
client authentication such as MTLS [@I-D.ietf-oauth-mtls] or
`private_key_jwt` [@!OpenID]. When asymmetric methods for client
authentication are used, authorization servers do not need to store
sensitive symmetric keys, making these methods more robust against a
number of attacks.


## Other Recommendations

Authorization servers SHOULD NOT allow clients to influence their
`client_id` or `sub` value or any other claim that might cause
confusion with a genuine resource owner (see (#client_impersonating)).
